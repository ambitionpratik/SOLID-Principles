The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make object-oriented software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles help in writing clean code that is easy to extend and refactor.

**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
